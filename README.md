This application is an income tracker. As of now, it is primarily HTML and CSS, but I would like to add JavaScript and CRUD functionality to allow me to create income spreadsheets with multiple pagegs in this single-page application.

## GOALS
Use CRUD to:
 1. Add income data through input fields in the table and save to firebase.
 1. Use `OnLoad()` to retrieve the saved data from firebase.
 1. Ability to edit past entries.
 1. No ability to delete, other than in Firebase.
 1. Allow ability to render other spreadsheets.

 Stretch Goals: 
  1. Click an arrow next to the table, and another organization object comes up.
